> - The Inventory Agent detects low stock levels
> - It requests demand forecasts from the Demand Agent
> - The Supplier Agent coordinates with suppliers
> - The Route Agent optimizes delivery routes"

#### Step 3: MeTTa Knowledge Graph Queries (30 seconds)
**Visual**: MeTTa query results
**Narrator**:
> "The agents query the MeTTa Knowledge Graph for:
> - Historical inventory data
> - Demand patterns and seasonal factors
> - Supplier performance metrics
> - Route efficiency data"

#### Step 4: Autonomous Decision Making (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Decision logs and calculations
**Narrator**:
> "Agents make autonomous decisions:
> - Calculating reorder quantities based on demand forecasts
> - Selecting optimal suppliers based on cost and reliability
> - Optimizing routes using distance and traffic data
> - Updating knowledge graphs with new information"

#### Step 5: Real-Time Collaboration (15 seconds)
**Visual**: Multi-agent message flow
**Narrator**:
> "The agents work together seamlessly, sharing information and coordinating actions to optimize the entire supply chain."

### 4. Agentverse Integration (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Agentverse interface or agent registration logs
**Narrator**:
> "All agents are registered on Agentverse and accessible through ASI:One. Users can interact with the system through natural language, and the agents will coordinate to provide optimal supply chain solutions."

**Key Points**:
- Show agent registration
- Demonstrate ASI:One compatibility
- Highlight Chat Protocol functionality

### 5. Results and Impact (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Performance metrics and optimization results
**Narrator**:
> "Our system delivers real-world impact:
> - Reduced inventory costs through optimized reorder points
> - Improved delivery efficiency through route optimization
> - Enhanced supplier relationships through performance tracking
> - Better demand forecasting through historical pattern analysis"

**Key Points**:
- Show optimization metrics
- Highlight cost savings
- Demonstrate efficiency improvements

### 6. Conclusion (15 seconds)
**Visual**: System overview with all agents active
**Narrator**:
> "This demonstrates the power of decentralized AI agents working together to solve complex supply chain challenges. The system is ready for deployment and can scale to handle real-world supply chain operations."

**Key Points**:
- Summarize key benefits
- Highlight ASI Alliance technology usage
- Mention scalability and real-world applicability
